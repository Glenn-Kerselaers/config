#	Default value is slicer.
#	Allowed values: slicer, file
#buttons: [status,pause,cancel,resume],[files,emergency,macros,shutdown]
#	You can redefine, which buttons and in which position you want displayed.
#	If this is not defined, the default order is used. Buttons are defined per row, each row separated.
#	This allows you to add your own custom macros to the bot's keyboard as well. 
#	Add or replace default bot commands with "/%macro_name%. The macro listed in this section
#	should be defined in klipper config files, in UPPERCASE. Maximum macro name length is 54 chars.
#	This value is not validated automatically.
#require_confirmation_macro: true

#	This value should be boolean.
#progress_update_message: false

#	This value should be boolean.	
#silent_progress: false
#	If progress_update_message is set to true, setting this to "true" sends the printer status change without an alert. 
#	You still get a "red" notification. Sadly the bot API does not permit sending "grey" completely silent messages. 
#	There is no way to work around that. 
#	Default is false.
#	This value should be boolean.
#silent_commands: false
#	Sends all other messages (for example the emergency stop confirmation) without an alert.You still get a "red" notification, 
#	but it does not have sound or vibration.

#	Default is false.
#	This value should be boolean.
#include_macros_in_command_list: true
#	This enables in-chat autocomplete for macros. 
#	Default is true.
